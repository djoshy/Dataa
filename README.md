My first "major" Android app. Requires 3rd party libraries Andengine and AndengineBox2DExtension.

App is quite simple really.

Stack simulates well a "stack" :P by dropping legos and removeing the top one.

Queue simulates a "queue" by forming a line of cars, each waiting for the front one to move.
